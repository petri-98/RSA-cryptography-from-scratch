# RSA-cryptography-from-scratch
Implementing the glorious cryptography algorithm from scratch in Python

I created this detailed notebook where I show every single step to build the RSA cryptography algorithm. The notebook includes:
- ASCII encoding schemes, to encode a text message into an integer and vice versa;
- Maths functions needed in the process, with a brief description of each;
- A routine to find arbitrarily large prime numbers (one of the main steps);
- The RSA Key generator;
- The encryption/decryption functions;
- Two tests.

I hope you will find it clear and useful.
